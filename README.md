# SWTL CMS

A lightweight CMS that works entirely in the browser using Service Workers and GitHub as a backend.

The main features of this CMS are:
- declarative configuration for content (collections of items with custom fields)
- easy extensibility of default content types â€“ create a standard web-component
  that implements ElementInternals and uses [`setFormValue`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals/setFormValue)
  when value is updated
